    <title>Where's My IP?</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>
What Is It?
</h2>
<p>WheresMyIp.org is an open-source and crowd-sourced-data project striving to
provide free as-accurate-as-possible IP to geographic location information for
the IoT age.  As devices become more portable and location-aware, getting exact
information for the location of any device (especially IPv6 devices) will get
more and more difficult. Although client devices know where they are, there's no
way for servers (or other clients in a Peer-To-Peer environment) to know where
each-other are.</p>
<p>Although commercial databases (like MaxMind) exist, they cost a lot of money
and can't keep up-to-date with edge devices.  Thus, we're attempting to create
a crowd-sourced database driven by the community</p>
<h2>How do I contribute information?</h2>
<p>Grab one of our client SDKs to start contributing data</p>
<p>Browser SDK:</p>
<code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/issacg/wheresmyip/wheresmyip-browser.js"/&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
&lt;script&gt;wheresmyip.submit();&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
<p>Do-it-yourself</p>
<p>Make a POST request to https://api.wheresmyip.org/ip<br/>The POST content
should be type <code>application/json</code> and contain a JSON object
containing the two properties <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> with
decimal lattitude/longitude coordinates.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>{"lat": 41.9040, "lon": 12.4530}</code>
<h2>How can I get data?</h2>
<p>Send requests to https://api.wheresmyip.org/ip/&lt;address&gt;</p> where
"address" is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.  Bear in mind that as a young and
crowdsourced project, there isn't much data yet...</p>
<p>The output will be a JSON object containing the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IP - The ip address requested</li>
    <li>Lat - The last known lattitude associated with the IP</li>
    <li>Lon- The last known longitude associated with the IP</li>
    <li>LastUpdated - The unix-timestamp of the last update for the given IP</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>If you're using a modern browser which supports the GeoLocation API (most
do), then click this button to submit
<a href="http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com">your IP</a> to our database</p>
<button onclick="wheresmyip.submit()">Submit My Data</button>
<br/>
<form id="lookupForm">
<script>
    function lookupMyIP() {
        document.getElementById("lookupForm").action = "https://api.wheresmyip.org/ip/" + document.getElementById("addrToCheck").value;
        document.getElementById("lookupForm").submit();
    }
</script>

<input type="text" value="127.0.0.1" id="addrToCheck"><button onclick="lookupMyIP()">Look up info</button>
</form>
<br/>
<p><a href="http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com">What's my IP?</a></p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you support IPv6?</li>
        <p>Sortof.  The database and application support it.  It's currently not on a dual-stack endpoint, so can't accept IPv6 submissions, but once the endpoint is dual-stack, it will work.</p>
        <li>Can I set it up on my own?</li>
        <p>There will (hopefully soon) be a script to install the entire stack on your Amazon AWS account.  If you don't get much traffic, you'll be fine on the free tier.  Check the /install folder on GitHub</p>
        <li>Can I contribute code</li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/issacg/wheresmyip">Fork us and submit pull requests</a></p>
        <li>Why does it look like sh*t?</li>
        <p>This project was (so far) the result of an 8-hour hackathon hosted by <a href="http://ironsrc.com">ironSource</a>.  Most of my time went to writing the application (and starting the installer).  Plus, my HTML skills suck.  Sorry 'bout that...</p>
